# rospca

The rospca package contains the implementation of Robust Sparse PCA using the ROSPCA algorithm of @rospca.
Moreover, the simulation study and glass dataset discussed in this paper are included.

This package relies heavily on the code from Valentin Todorov for *rrcov* and on the *mrfDepth* package.

The package is not available on CRAN but you can install the package using the binaries for *rospca* and *mrfDepthLight* from
[https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/software#rospca](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/software#rospca). 
The latest development version can be installed from GitHub using

```
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("TReynkens/rospca")
```
If you work on Windows, make sure first that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed when installing the development version from GitHub.
